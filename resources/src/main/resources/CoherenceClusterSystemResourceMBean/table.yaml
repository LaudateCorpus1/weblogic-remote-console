  <p>Coherence provides replicated and distributed data management and
      caching services that you can use to reliably make an application's
      objects and data available to all servers in a Coherence cluster. To do
      this, WebLogic Server retains configuration information used to locate and
      communicate with a Coherence cluster.</p>
      <p>This page displays the Coherence cluster configurations that have been
      created in this domain.</p>

  <p>Because each WebLogic Server domain can run concurrent, multiple
  instances of WebLogic Server, WebLogic logging services collect
  messages that are generated on multiple server instances into a single,
  domain-wide message log. You can use this domain-wide message log to
  see the overall status of the domain.</p><p>Use this page to configure
  the message log for this WebLogic Server domain.</p>
